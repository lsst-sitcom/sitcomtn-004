   This tech note describes the implementation of the various Look-Up Tables (LUTs) for the Rubin Observatory Active Optics System (AOS). The subsystems involved are the M1M3, M2, the M2 hexapod, and the camera hexapod. This note is meant to be a guide for the subsystem software developers, and for the scientists who are updating the LUTs, both during commissioning and operations.
